  "LongDescription": "There's no sound, but there sure are plenty of laughs. This crazy Quebec-based troupe uses the city as its stage, and its inhabitants, or victims, as characters! People are caught in a twisted yet funny web of comedic deception. This updated \"Candid Camera\" is a tad more risque and a little kookier with its practical jokes. The little snippets last only a few minutes, and some look more painful than others.",
