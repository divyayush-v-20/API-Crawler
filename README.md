## API CRAWLER

POC to develop API Crawling code based on the API Documentation.

### Description

POC to enhance the Python-based API client code generator by incorporating advanced features such as rate limiting, retry mechanisms, and logging into the generated client code.
The system will parse structured API documentation, generate robust API client code, and ensure reliability through automated testing, error correction, and organized output, building on the existing API client code generator capabilities.
